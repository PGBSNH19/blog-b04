# ACI & Docker

## 1a: Hello World in Docker

1. Install Docker: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2. Reboot your computer

3. Add a Docker file

   Navigate to your repository in your CLI and then enter the following command:

   ```
   touch Dockerfile
   ```

   This will generate a dockerfile in your current directory. 

   *Note: You can also add the dockerfile by rightclicking the solution, then Add->Dockersupport..* 

   Open the file in Visual Studio or any other texte-ditor and add the following:

   ```
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1-buster-slim AS base
   WORKDIR /app
   EXPOSE 80
   EXPOSE 443
   
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1-buster AS build
   WORKDIR /src
   COPY ["SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj", ""]
   RUN dotnet restore "./SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj"
   COPY . .
   WORKDIR "/src/."
   RUN dotnet build "SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build
   
   FROM build AS publish
   RUN dotnet publish "SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish
   
   FROM base AS final
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
   ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "SimpleWebHalloWorld.dll"]
   ```

   This will expose the ports 80 (http) and 443 (https) for your container, select the workdirectory and select ASP.NET 3.1 core for your image. 

   We run the dotnet restore to make sure that we copy all the dependencies required to our image. 

   **We also have to change the ports in our launchSettings.json**

   Open launchSettings.json in Visual Studio or any other texteditor.

   Find and edit the applicationUrl like this:

   ```
         "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:443;http://localhost:80"
   ```

4. Build your image and run it in a container

   Now when we have set up our Dockerfile, we will build our container. Open your CLI of choice and login to Docker, then run the following command:

   ```
   docker build -t <image_name> .
   ```

   Choose a name for your image in the <> brackets. 

   This will build an image with your specified name and store it with Docker. To remove an image you can enter:

   ```
   docker rmi <imagename>
   ```

   Now that we have an image we need to put it in a container. To put the image in a container and run it with Docker, enter the following command:

   ```
   docker run -d -p <internal_port>:<external_port> --name <container_name> <image_name>
   ```

   This will generate a container using the specified image in that container and then run this on the specified ports. The complete command can look like this:

   ```
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name simplewebhalloworldcontainer simplewebhalloworld
   ```

   *Note: -d is the internal port and -p is the external port*.

   Open the Docker dekstop-app, the example above should look like this:

## 1b: Hello World with Docker Compose

1. Add a docker-compose file to your project.

   Navigate to your repository in your CLI and then enter the following command:

   ```
   touch docker-compose.yml
   ```

   Open the file in Visual Studio or any other text-editor, and add the following:

```
version: '3'
services:
	web:
		build: .
		ports:
			- "8080:80"
```

This will add a webservice on the ports 8080:80. You may enter more than one service in this file, but you need to make sure that no services more than one run on the same ports. 



## 2 Publish your Hello World container image

1. Login to Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com/

2. Navigate to Container registries

3. In the top-left corner, click Add.

4. Enter the required information, example:

   ![img](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/280760711620067330/752514170833993769/unknown.png?width=399&height=300)

5. Click on review + create.

6. Open the registry and make sure it has been created, take note of the login name in the top-right corner. 

   Example:

![img](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/280760711620067330/753515894554099773/unknown.png?width=400&height=138)

7. Now we need to login to Azure in our CLI.

   Enter the following command:

   ```
   az login
   ```

   and then:

   *Note: make sure that you're still logged in to Docker, otherwise run the docker login command again.*

   ```
   az acr login --name <register_name.azurecr.io>
   ```

   This will login to your specified azure registry.

8. If we want to publish our container image, we need to tag it, so we enter the following command:

   ```
   docker tag <source-image_name> <register_name.azurecr.io>/<target-image_name>:<tag>
   ```

9. To push the tagged container, we enter the following: 

   ```
   docker push <registry_name.azurecr.io>/<target-image_name>:<tag>
   ```

   *Note: after the container has been pushed you may remove it locally with the docker rmi command.*

   In Azure portal you should now see your repository in the services tab. 

   *Note: If you removed your local image, check that you can pull and run the container locally by entering the following command in your CLI:*

   ```
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 <registry_name.azurecr.io>/<image_name>:<tag>
   ```

   If everything works we should now get our SSH-key as response in the CLI.

   ## 3: Azure Container Instance

   We will now run our container in the cloud by using ACI (Azure Container Instance).

   1. First we need to login to Azure, enter:

   ```
   az login
   ```

   Find your registry with the container that you want to run in the cloud.

   2. Login with your registryname 

      ```
      az acr login --name <registry_name.azurecr.io>
      ```

   *If you don't have a resource group already, you need to create one. You can enter the following command:*

```
az group create --name --location northeurope
```

3. Authenticate using the service principal

   Navigate to your registry inside the Azure portal, in the menu on the left click Access Keys.

   Enable the Admin user, example:

   ![img](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/280760711620067330/753514736712286259/unknown.png?width=720&height=586)

4. Open your CLI and run the following script:

   ```
   az container create
   --resource-group <resource_group>
   --name <container_name>
   --image <container_registry.azurecr.io>/<image_name>:<tag>
   --registry-login-server <container_registry.azurecr.io>
   --registry-username <user_name>
   --registry-password <password>
   ```
