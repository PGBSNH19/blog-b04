# Azure Release and Deployment

In this guide we will be configuring a release pipeline, Azure Artifacts, and a deployment of a web application in Azure. 



1. Log in to Azure Portal and create a Azure Web App Service.

2. Login to Azure DevOps and navigate to your pipelines.

3. Click new release pipeline 

4. Click on the stage that you want to configure for deployment

5. Enter the following information:  

   ​         ![stage deployment.png](https://github.com/PGBSNH19/blog-b04/blob/master/img/stage%20deployment.png?raw=true)      

   *Note: Click the icon marked in red to get more information about the corresponding field.*

6. In the top-right corner, click the save button.

7. Choose an existing, or create a new folder for your pipeline:

   ​          ![release pipeline.png](https://github.com/PGBSNH19/blog-b04/blob/master/img/release%20pipeline.png?raw=true)      

**Artifacts**

Azure Artifacts manages the dependencies for the codebase, such as NuGet, npm, Maven etc. Azure Artifacts controls your dependencies with upstream resources through feeds. Feeds allows you to group packages and control who has access to them with permissions. 



To add an artifact to your project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your release pipeline

2. Click on the Artifacts | Add button:

   ![artifacts add.png](https://github.com/PGBSNH19/blog-b04/blob/master/img/artifacts%20add.png?raw=true)

3. Enter the project, the source of the build (the build pipeline), which version of the build and a source alias.

   ​          ![artifacts fields.png](https://github.com/PGBSNH19/blog-b04/blob/master/img/artifacts%20fields.png?raw=true)      

   Done, next up is setting up the release and deployment. 

   ​              

**Release**

1. Click create new release in the top-right corner. 

   ![create release](img\Create%20release.png)

2. Select the stage you configured earlier.

3. Select the version of the artifact source you want to use for the release. 

4. If you want to you can add a description for your release. (optional)

5. Navigate to Pipelines -> Releases.

6. Click on the stage you want to deploy.

7. Click on deploy.

Add comment if you want to. (optional)



**To test that your release is up and running:**

1. Navigate to your Azure Web App service in the Azure Portal.

2. Copy the link into the browser, the service should now be running!

*Note: You have to start your service if you haven't already.*





## So how much does it cost to host a web service in Azure?

### **Prices**

The average person use between **2 - 5 gigabytes** of data each day using their phone. The average American spends **5.4 hours** per day on their phone, and they spend **144 minutes** per day on social media. 

We will be rounding these numbers a little bit for this exercise. Assuming that the average person use 3.5 gigabytes per day, during the 5.4 hours per day, checks out to about **10 megabytes** of traffic per minute. So the the average person uses about **1.5** **gigabytes** per day on social media. 

For the purpose of this blog post we're going to assume that we run a **social media website** that gets **10 minutes** of traffic every day from each user. Let's also assume that we have **1000 unique users every day**, and **5000 users registered**. That's **100 gigabytes** of traffic every day, and **300 gigabytes every month.** 



We will use an Azure App Service plan, since we're theoretically hosting this in a production environment we'll use the **standard level**. The instance will these specs: **2 cores, 3.5 gigabytes of ram and 50 gigabytes of** storage. This service will cost us **$139**.

​          ![app service plan.png](https://github.com/PGBSNH19/blog-b04/blob/master/img/app%20service%20plan.png?raw=true)      







Next up we will need a **container registry** to put our App Service in. Again we will use a standard level registry since we're in a production environment. For the purpose of this exercise, we're also assuming that we're hosting the full codebase frontend through backend in a single instance. Incoming traffic is about **300 gigabytes**, assuming we will be trafficking a lot more data to the users than the user does to us, we will put the bandwidth to **2000 gigabytes** in this example, which will net our price to **$194**.

​          ![registry plan.png](https://github.com/PGBSNH19/blog-b04/blob/master/img/registry%20plan.png?raw=true)      

We will also need a database to store information about our users in. In this exercise we will try to conserve some money using a **server-less Azure SQL-database**. These are the specs we will use for the database: 

​          ![sql database spec.png](https://github.com/PGBSNH19/blog-b04/blob/master/img/sql%20database%20spec.png?raw=true)      

We use a general purpose database, but we specify the lowest virtual cores set to 4 and highest virtual cores set to 16, in case we get a lot of traffic. 

We set the storage to **4 terrabytes**.

​          ![storage.png](https://github.com/PGBSNH19/blog-b04/blob/master/img/storage.png?raw=true)      

The database will cost **$522**.

The total price of running our application in the cloud will cost us **$855/month**.
