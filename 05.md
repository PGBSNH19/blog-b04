# Azure SQL vs Cosmos database

The cost of your database model may vary a lot depending on how much traffic your database has. The following examples use the a pay-as-you go alternative. Depending on your needs the choice of database solution can vary quite a bit. Some things to have in mind are: the longer you reserve server space the cheaper it gets, more database requests, CPU-cores, memory and newer hardware will cost you more. If your database and/or server are crucial to keep your business running you can pay extra to be sure that they always are. 

As you're starting to notice it's not really that simple to just go with an option, it really does depend on what your needs are. The good thing about azure is that scalability often is really easy. Down below you have some examples on the difference in prince between a SQL and Cosmos database.

## Azure SQL-database

* Pay as you go: **$1470/month**, provisioned, general purpose.

  - One instance for 730h.
  - 1 year reserved capacity **$1160/month**.
  - 3 year reserved capacity **$980/month**.

  You can reduce your cost of your SQL-license with up to 40% if you use **Azure Hybrid Benefit**. 



There's a huge price difference if you decide to go with the server-less SQL option.

## Azure Cosmos DB

* Pay as you go: **$0.016/hour**

  - **$1.6/hour** if you get 100 requests per second for 1 hour.

  *Example:*

  1000 requests/s for 730h  costs **$116/month**.

  * 1 year reserved capacity **$96/month**.
  * 3 year reserved capacity **$84/month**.

# Setting up a serverless database using Azure 

This guide requires an existing Entity Framework application that is able to migrate to a new database. 

1. Log in to azure.

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. If you don't have a resource group you would like to use, create one.

   ```bash
   az group create --name <name> --location <location>
   ```

3. Create a server.

   ```bash
   az sql server create  --name <server_name> --resource-group <resourse_group> --location <location> --admin-user <username> --admin-password <password>
   ```

   *Note: choose a strong password since azure requires it.*
   *Gen5 with capacity 1 may not work, even though it's listed as a valid choice.*

4. Add Firewall rule in your server. Without this you wouldn't be able to access you server.

5. ```bash
   az sql server firewall-rule create --resource-group b04resources --server b04demosrv -n AllowYourIp --start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 --end-ip-address 0.0.0.0
   ```

6. Now it's time to finally create our database.

   ```bash
   az sql db create --resource-group b04resources --server b04demosrv --name b04demo-db --edition GeneralPurpose --family Gen5 --capacity 2 --compute-model Serverless --auto-pause-delay 120
   ```

7. To access you server either go to the azure portal and find your resource group and click on you server. To the upper right you can see your server name.
   Or you can use the CLI and look for the variable "fullyQualifiedDomainName":

   ```bash
   az sql server list
   ```

   *Note: server name looks like "mysever.database.windows.net".*

8. We need to add/change our connection string to connect to our database. Open your FILENAME and add this string:

   ```c#
   "ConnectionStrings": {    "b04-demo-application": "SERVER=b04demosrv.database.windows.net;DATABASE=b04demo.-;user=b04admin;password=***\****;"
   ```

9. To access you server go to your Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. When prompted to log in use your server name and the login information you choose in step (3).

10. Open the Package Manager Console and create a new migration.

    ```nuget
    Add-Migration <migration_name>
    ```

11. Open the Package Manager Console and update you database.

    ```nuget
    Update-Database
    ```

12. Refresh your server in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
