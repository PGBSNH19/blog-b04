# Continuous Integration, Delivery & Deployment with Azure DevOps

### Continuous Integration

Continuous integration, or CI for short, is a development practice that developers use to integrate code fast and easy, often multiple times a day. Each integration can be tested and built, so naturally bugs and issues with the code will be caught early. Tests are not necessary for CI, but they are often used this way because it's close at hand when using pipelines. 

### Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment is the practice to make sure that your code is always deployable. This includes configurations and tests. The idea is to keep the software-cycle short, i.e. deploying changes to the software often, instead of making big changes seldomly. Even if the application has passed all the tests or even QA (Quality Assurance)-passed, it's still not ready for deployment. There will still be someone manually pushing the application into production-stage, or post deployment tests. 

There is a difference between continuous delivery and **continuous deployment**. If the latest version of the application passes all the automated tests in the continuous deployment pipeline, the application will automatically be released to a test or production environment. This doesn't necessarily mean that the application is deployed to the all the end-users, there's also something called a deployment slot. A deployment slot, for example, may let users choose to opt-in for an early, updated version, of the application. This is called an A/B method (split-testing or bucket-testing). Usually only a small percentage of the user-base is accepted so we as developers may test our new features in a production environment. The users will usually have the option to roll back to the stable version of the application if they choose. 


## How to create a pipeline in Azure DevOps (using GitHub)

1. Login or register an account in Azure DevOps.

2. Navigate to Azure Pipelines

3. Create a new DevOps organization if you don't have one already.

4. Select your organisation and click the New project button in the top-right corner.

5. Create a new pipeline for your project.

6. Select GitHub as your source, and select the repository you want to use for your pipeline.

   *Note: Login to GitHub if you're prompted.*

7. Select GitHub repository that you want to use for your pipeline

8. Configure your pipeline

- *Depending on what you choose here, different yml will be generated for you. We will pick ASP.NET Core (.NET Framework).*

9. Review the .yml-code generated for you, it should look like this: 
   
   ```yaml
   # ASP.NET Core (.NET Framework)
   # Build and test ASP.NET Core projects targeting the full .NET Framework.
   # Add steps that publish symbols, save build artifacts, and more:
   # https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/dotnet-core
   
   trigger:
   - master
   
   pool:
     vmImage: 'windows-latest'
   
   variables:
     solution: '**/*.sln'
     buildPlatform: 'Any CPU'
     buildConfiguration: 'Release'
   
   steps:
   - task: NuGetToolInstaller@1
   
   - task: NuGetCommand@2
     inputs:
       restoreSolution: '$(solution)'
   
   - task: VSBuild@1
     inputs:
       solution: '$(solution)'
       msbuildArgs: '/p:DeployOnBuild=true /p:WebPublishMethod=Package /p:PackageAsSingleFile=true /p:SkipInvalidConfigurations=true /p:DesktopBuildPackageLocation="$(build.artifactStagingDirectory)\WebApp.zip" /p:DeployIisAppPath="Default Web Site"'
       platform: '$(buildPlatform)'
       configuration: '$(buildConfiguration)'
   
   - task: VSTest@2
     inputs:
       platform: '$(buildPlatform)'
       configuration: '$(buildConfiguration)'
   
   ```
   
   

Hit save and run and that's it. The pipeline is now created. In the next steps we will configure the pipeline for continuous integration. 

## Add continuous integration/delivery to your Azure DevOps pipeline.

The pipeline should now be working just fine, but it won't automatically push new images to your container instance. Right now it's simply working of the image you created and only that image. All the changes that you make in your application won't be uploaded to the cloud unless we make some configurations to our .yml. 

First, we need to make sure that we are authorized to use the Azure resources with the pipeline we connected. In this tutorial we will be creating a service connection that you can use for all the pipelines in the project. 

1. Navigate to your project in Azure DevOps. 

2. Click settings in the bottom-left corner. 

3. Click on **Service connections**.

4. In the top-right corner, click **New service connection**.

5. Select **Azure Resource Manager**.

6. Select **Service principal (automatic)**

7. Select the Azure subscription and the resource group that you want to use.

8. Create a name for the service connection & click the Save button. This is the name that we will use in the .yml file when we need to authorize with Azure.

   We have now established a new service principal. If you have several people working on the same project, you can also include them in your service principal. 

   1. In your service connection, click Manage service principal.
   2. Click owners, then add and invite the people you want specifying their e-mail. 

   ### Configuring the azure-pipelines.yml for continuous integration

   1. First, we will create a few variables that we will use in our configuration. Right now our configuration is going to be kind of small, so it might seem pretty redundant for the moment but when your configuration gets bigger and with more tasks, variables becomes very useful. 

   ```yaml
   # The script will trigger whenever something is pushed to the master bransch. 
   trigger:
   - master
   # The only resource for the repository in this case is the application. 
   resources:
   - repo: self
   
   variables:
     # Container registry service connection established during pipeline creation
     dockerRegistryServiceConnection: '******-****-****-****-*********'
     # The name of your image without the :<tag>. 
     imageRepository: 'image_repository_name'
     # Locates the source of the Dockerfile in your repository. 
     dockerfilePath: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/Dockerfile'
     # Sets the tag variable to the build id.
     tag: '$(Build.BuildId)'
     # Here we use the Service principal that we established earlier.
     azureSubscription: ConnectionName
     vmImageName: 'ubuntu-latest'
   ```

   2. Here we will configure Docker to create and push a new image for us to our specified container registry. For future configuration (testing, continuous deployment) we specify stages. In this stage we will Build and push our application to the cloud. 

      ```yaml
      stages:
      - stage: Build
      # The name that will be displayed when you run the pipeline.
        displayName: Build and push stage
        jobs:
        - job: Build
          displayName: Build
          pool:
            vmImage: $(vmImageName)
          steps:
          - task: Docker@2
            displayName: Build and push an image to container registry
            inputs:
              command: buildAndPush
              repository: $(imageRepository)
              dockerfile: $(dockerfilePath)
              containerRegistry: $(dockerRegistryServiceConnection)
              # Tags the image with the specified variable we 
              tags: |
                $(tag)
      ```

      Since this is not deploying automatically, you will have to create a new container instance manually based on the latest image version. 

      

      *Note: Check the previous post on how to create an Azure Container Instance.*

## Tests

If you want to add unit testing to your project, we need to add and configure a task in the azure-pipelines.yml file.

1. If you haven't already, create the test-project and code some tests for your project.

2. Open the azure-pipelines.yml file in Visual Studio or any other text-editor.

3. Create a new task like this:

   ```yaml
   - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
     inputs:
       command: test
       projects: '**/testfolder_test/project_tests.csproj'
       arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
   ```

   This piece of code will run the DotNetCoreCLI, take the input-command "test" and then specify which project that should run. The tests will now automatically run when you push your project to the pipeline. You can see the test passed if you check your latest commits in the pipeline, and it will look like this if all your tests passes:
