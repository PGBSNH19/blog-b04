## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration, or CI for short, is a development practice that developers use to integrate code fast and easy, often multiple times a day. Each integration can be tested and built, so naturally bugs and issues with the code will be caught early. Tests are not necessary for CI, but they are often used this way because it's close at hand when using pipelines. 

### Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment is the practice to make sure that your code is always deployable. This includes configurations and tests. The idea is to keep the software-cycle short, i.e. deploying changes to the software often, instead of making big changes seldomly. Even if the application has passed all the tests or even QA (Quality Assurance)-passed, it's still not ready for deployment. There will still be someone manually pushing the application into production-stage, or post deployment tests. 

There is a difference between continuous delivery and **continuous deployment**. If the latest version of the application passes all the automated tests in the continuous deployment pipeline, the application will automatically be released to a test or production environment. This doesn't necessarily mean that the application is deployed to the all the end-users, there's also something called a deployment slot. A deployment slot, for example, may let users choose to opt-in for an early, updated version, of the application. This is called an A/B method (split-testing or bucket-testing). Usually only a small percentage of the user-base is accepted so we as developers may test our new features in a production environment. The users will usually have the option to roll back to the stable version of the application if they choose. 


## How to create a pipeline in Azure Devops (using GitHub)
1. Login or register an account in Azure DevOps.
2. Navigate to Azure Pipelines
3. Create a new DevOps organisation if you don't have one already.

4. Select your organisation and click the New project button in the top-right corner.

5. Create a new pipeline for your project.

6. Select GitHub as your source, and select the repository you want to use for your pipeline.

   *Note: Login to GitHub if you're prompted.*

7. Select GitHub repository that you want to use for your pipeline

8. Configure your pipeline
- Depending on what you choose here, different yaml will be generated for you. We will pick ASP.NET Core (.NET Framework).

9. Review the YAML-code generated for you, it should look like this:

## Tests

If you want to add unit testing to your project, you need to add some settings to the azure-pipelines.yml file.

1. If you haven't already, create the test-project and code some tests for your project.

2. Open the azure-pipelines.yml file in Visual Studio or any other text-editor.

3. Create a new task like this:

   ```yaml
   - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
     inputs:
       command: test
       projects: '**/testfolder_test/project_tests.csproj'
       arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
   ```

   This piece of code will run the DotNetCoreCLI, take the input-command "test" and then specify which project that should run. The tests will now automatically run when you push your project to the pipeline. You can see the test passed if you check your latest commits in the pipeline, and it will look like this if all your tests passes:
