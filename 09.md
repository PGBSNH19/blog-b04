# Microsoft Application Insights

Today we're going to implement logging and telemetry to a simple console application, so that we can monitor our application with the Microsoft Application Insights service in Azure. Logging is a powerful way to monitor how your application is running. There are a few different ways to accomplish this but we will be using Microsoft Logging and Microsoft Application Insights. In this tutorial we will be logging to both the console and the cloud. 



1. First, we need to add Microsoft.Extensions.Logging and Dependency Injection to our project. 

```c#
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
```

2. Here we create a logger.

```C#
        var serviceProvider = new ServiceCollection()
            .AddLogging(cfg => cfg.AddConsole())
            .Configure<LoggerFilterOptions>(cfg => cfg.MinLevel = LogLevel.Debug)
            .BuildServiceProvider();

        var logger = serviceProvider.GetService<ILogger<Program>>();
```
3. We decide what we want to log by using logger.LogInformation().

```c#
            var rand = new Random();
            bool runApp = true;
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key for pretty exit");
            while (runApp)
            {
                int randomSleep = rand.Next(1, 50);
                //Here we use the logger to log information to the console. 
                logger.LogInformation("Sleeping for: {0} seconds. ", 	SleepTimeToSec(randomSleep).ToString());

                Thread.Sleep(randomSleep * 100);
            }
```

4. Done, the project now logs to the console!
